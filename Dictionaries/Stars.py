#This is a challenging one! The output will be very long as
#you'll be working on some pretty big dictionaries. We don't
#expect everyone to be able to do it, but it's a good chance
#to test how far you've come!
#
#Write a function called stars that takes in two
#dictionaries:
#
# - movies: a dictionary where the keys are movie titles and
#   the values are lists of major performers in the movie. For
#   example: movies["The Dark Knight"] = ["Christian Bale",
#   "Heath Ledger", "Maggie Gyllenhall", "Aaron Eckhart"]
# - tvshows: a dictionary where the keys are TV show titles
#   and the values lists of major performers in the show.
#   For example: tvshows["Community"] = ["Joel McHale", "Alison
#   Brie", "Danny Pudi", "Donald Glover", "Yvette Brown"]
#
#The function stars should return a new dictionary. The keys
#of the new dictionary should be the performers' names, and
#the values for each key should be the list of shows and
#movies in which that performer has appeared. Sort the shows
#and movies alphabetically.


#Write your function here!

    #Now, we want to separately go through the
    #movies and tvshows dictionaries. Let's start with
    #movies.
    #
    #We're going to iterate through every
    #movie-performers pair in the dictionary:
    
    for movie, performers in movies.items():
        
        #Now, movie is a string, and performers is a
        #list of strings. The strings in performers
        #are people: that's what we want the keys to
        #our new dictionary to be. So, we iterate
        #through each performer in this movie's list
        #of performers:
        
        for performer in performers:
            
            #Now, performer is the name of one person.
            #We want that person to be in new_dict as
            #a key, with a list of their movies and
            #TV shows as the value.
            #
            #If they're already in new_dict, we just
            #want to add this movie to their list.
            #But first, we should check to see if
            #they're already in new_dict: if they
            #aren't, then there's no list to add to!
            
            if performer not in new_dict:
                
                #If they aren't, then we should create
                #a new key with this performer's name,
                #and give it an empty list as its value:
                
                new_dict[performer] = []
                
            #Here, we can guarantee that performer is now
            #a key in new_dict: if it wasn't before, we
            #just added it! So, we can now add movie to
            #the list.
            #
            #We access the list with new_dict[performer],
            #and we can then call append(movie) directly:
            
            new_dict[performer].append(movie)
            
            #And that's all! We've now added movie to this
            #performer's value in new_dict. If this
            #performer wasn't already in new_dict, we added
            #them first.
            
    #Next, we do the *exact* same thing for tvshows. In fact,
    #it's identical: the code below is copy/pasted from above,
    #but with tvshow used instead of movie. So, it works
    #identically:
    for tvshow, performers in tvshows.items():
        for performer in performers:
            if performer not in new_dict:
                new_dict[performer] = []
            new_dict[performer].append(tvshow)
            
    #Now, recall that we have to sort the names of each
    #performer's movies and TV shows alphabetically. How do
    #we do that? We could have re-sorted them each time we
    #appended a new movie or TV show, but that would be
    #inefficient: we'd sort a lot more often than we need to.
    #Instead, let's go through all the performers at the end
    #and sort their lists.
    #
    #So, we iterate through each performer-performances pair
    #in new_dict:
    
    for performer, performances in new_dict.items():
        
        #And sort the performances. Remember, lists are
        #mutable, so any methods we run on them like
        #performances.sort() change them in place: we don't
        #need to set performances equal to the sorted version
        #of itself.
        
        performances.sort()
        
    #Now we're done!
    
    return new_dict

    #Notice, though, that the TV shows code was identical to
    #the movies code. That's generally undesirable. What if
    #we made a mistake? We'd have to fix it in two places.
    #Instead, we should encapsulate that reasoning in a
    #separate function that we can call separately on movies
    #and TV shows. Check out sample_answer_2.py for that.

#Our reasoning here will be largely the same, but we
#want to create a separate function to handle
#transforming movie-performers dictionaries into a
#performer-performances dictionary.
#
#So, let's first write a general function that does
#that. It will take two parameters: the original
#dictionary (something like movies or tvshows, which
#maps performance names to lists of performers) and
#the new dictionary (which maps performer names to
#lists of performances):

def movies_to_performers(orig_dict, new_dict):
    for performance, performers in orig_dict.items():
        for performer in performers:
            if performer not in new_dict:
                new_dict[performer] = []
            new_dict[performer].append(performance)
            
#Compare this to the reasoning in sample_answer_1.py.
#You'll see it's *identical*: all we did was replace
#movies or tvshows with orig_dict, and movie or tvshow
#with performance.
#
#What good does that do us? Check out how simple our
#stars() function is now:

def stars(movies, tvshows):
    new_dict = {}
    movies_to_performers(movies, new_dict)
    movies_to_performers(tvshows, new_dict)
    
    for performer, performances in new_dict.items():
        performances.sort()
    return new_dict

    #By using a function like movies_to_performers, we let
    #ourselves call that long block of code multiple times
    #in only one line of code each.
