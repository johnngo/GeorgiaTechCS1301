#We've written the function, sort_with_select, below. It takes

#involves finding the minimum value and moving it to an
#earlier spot in the list.

#to complete the selection_sort function. You should only need
#to modify the section marked 'Write your code here!'

            #complete the algorithm! Remember, the goal is
            #to find the lowest item in the list between
            #index i and the end of the list, and store its
            #index in the variable minIndex.
